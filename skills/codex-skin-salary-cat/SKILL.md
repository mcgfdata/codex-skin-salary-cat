# Install Salary Cat Codex Skin

Install the existing theme; never generate or replace its artwork.

## Workflow

1. Resolve the plugin root two directories above this `SKILL.md`.
2. Detect macOS or Windows.
3. Run the plugin root's full setup entry for that platform.
4. Verify that the installed theme ID is `preset-yuexinmiao`.
5. Report “installed” and “applied” separately.

## macOS

Before an action that may restart Codex, tell the user. Run `Setup.command` from
the plugin root for complete setup. To avoid restarting the current task, run:

```bash
./scripts/setup-skin-macos.sh --no-apply
```

That command installs the official prerequisite when missing, installs Salary
Cat, and selects it for the next Dream Skin launch.

## Windows

Run `Setup.ps1` from the plugin root:

```powershell
powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\Setup.ps1
```

The first prerequisite install requires Codex to be closed. If it is open,
prepare the command and clearly tell the user to close Codex and run `Setup.cmd`.

## Safety

- Obtain the prerequisite only from `https://github.com/Fei-Away/Codex-Dream-Skin`.
- Do not modify official Codex files, signatures, API keys, or provider settings.
- Do not request administrator access.
